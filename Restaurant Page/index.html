<h3>About the Place</h3>
KainaN is a revived restaurant created for the sole purpose of offering cheap and filling meals for
students. Its history dates back from 2018 before the pandemic but slowed down during the pandemic
due to classes being put into online. But now its back! and better than before. It is located near
Adamson University with more branches to come soon. We are excited to see you again adamsonians!
